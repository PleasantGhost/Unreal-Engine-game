Core Weapon Classifications

1. Melee Weapons

Swords: Balanced in speed and power, swords can be one-handed or two-handed, with movesets focusing on quick slashes, thrusts, and elemental combo versatility.

Axes: Slower but powerful, often with a chance to stagger or knock back enemies. Axes might have greater synergy with Earth-based elements.

Spears: Long reach with piercing attacks, spears excel in crowd control and could have elemental effects that “chain” to nearby enemies.

Daggers: Very fast, allowing for close-range, rapid combos that work well with debuffing elements like Poison or Ice.

Hammers/Maces: Heavy weapons with high impact, ideal for smashing through shields or armor. Earth and Fire effects could add area damage or ignite enemies.

2. Ranged Weapons

Bows: Basic ranged weapon with speed and versatility; great for applying elemental effects over time, like Fire’s burn or Water’s slowing.

Crossbows: Slower than bows but with higher impact. Crossbows could synergize with Thunder for increased knockback or stun.

Throwing Stars/Knives: Fast, short-range projectiles that can be thrown in rapid succession. Great with elements that cause status effects, such as Poison or Ice.

Guns: High-speed projectile weapons that excel in first-person targeting mode, especially for elemental combo bursts.

3. Magic Weapons

Staffs: Versatile, ranged magic weapons that offer elemental projectiles or AoE spells. Staffs are ideal for Mages and could create lasting elemental fields on the battlefield.

Wands: More focused, single-target magic tools, potentially channeling energy quickly for precise elemental attacks.

Orbs/Tomes: Allow players to cast various elemental spells with a focus on support effects, like healing, shields, or buffs.

4. Hybrid Weapons

Claws/Fist Weapons: Fast, close-range melee weapons for relentless combo attacks. These might have a chance to deal multi-hit elemental effects like Fire or Poison.

Whips/Chains: Medium-range, flexible weapons that allow players to grab or trip enemies. These might work well with Wind to push or pull enemies.

Scythes: Versatile weapons with sweeping attacks, useful for crowd control and AoE damage. Could be strong with Life-Drain effects or Poison.

5. Heavy Weapons

Greatswords: High-damage, slower weapons, perfect for devastating area attacks. Greatswords could have an “aura” effect when enchanted, applying elemental damage to anything nearby.

Halberds: Long-reach weapons that blend slashing and piercing, ideal for crowd control and multi-target combos, especially with elements that spread effects like Fire.

Battle-Hammers: Massive blunt weapons that cause shockwaves with each hit. These would amplify Earth or Thunder, adding area knockback or a radial stun.

Special Weapon Attributes

Elemental Affinities: Each weapon type could have an affinity or synergy with certain elements. For example, hammers work better with Earth, while daggers are quicker with Ice.

Combo Focus: Certain weapons are better for specific combo styles. Swords and daggers, for instance, might offer more complex combos, while hammers focus on high-impact but fewer hits.

Unique Skills: Specific weapons within each classification could come with unique skills or passive abilities. For instance, a legendary sword might ignite foes on critical hits, while a rare spear channels lightning on charged thrusts.

Sub-Class Weapon Loadouts

Based on loadout combinations, players could discover unofficial subclasses by mixing compatible weapons. For instance:

Paladin: Warrior with sword, shield, and holy staff (gives access to healing and light magic).

Battle Mage: Mage with a sword and staff combination, offering magic-imbued melee attacks.

Assassin: Rogue with a dagger and crossbow loadout for quick close-range attacks with ranged flexibility.
