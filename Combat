The combat is fast-paced and deeply strategic, with players constantly shifting between different weapons, elemental attacks, and unique combos to face large hordes of enemies. Inspired by classic arcade games like Gauntlet: Dark Legacy, the game challenges players to think and act quickly, weaving through waves of enemies while using skillful combinations of physical attacks and elemental magic to survive and conquer.

Combat Flow and Mechanics

1. Fast-Paced, Reactive Combat:
As enemies swarm, players need to continuously move, dodge, and strike with fluidity, emphasizing both offensive and defensive play. The goal is to clear waves quickly while minimizing damage, making each moment in combat feel intense and dynamic. Similar to Street Fighter, players can execute rapid combos and chain attacks to build momentum, keeping enemies under pressure and maximizing damage output.

2. Combos and Flashy Attacks:
Every weapon in a player's loadout has unique movesets and combo chains. Players can string together light and heavy attacks for visually impressive and devastating moves, unlocking special effects with each combo tier. Combos allow players to juggle enemies in the air, hit multiple targets, or knock foes into others, creating a chaotic but controlled environment where combat feels fluid and powerful.

3. Ultimate Abilities and Charge System:
Inspired by Overwatch, players build an Ultimate Meter through successful attacks, taking damage, or performing unique abilities. Each ultimate attack is specific to the weapon and elemental loadout, letting players unleash a powerful, area-clearing move when fully charged. These ultimate attacks are pivotal in turning the tide during intense battles, clearing space or dealing massive damage to clustered enemies.

4. Elemental Enchantments and Effects:
Each weapon can be enchanted with one of four elemental effects (Fire, Water, Earth, Air), which add tactical depth to combat. Elements alter both offensive and defensive strategies by giving players the tools to apply status effects or manipulate enemy positioning.
Fire causes a burn effect, reducing enemy health over time and inciting panic among weaker foes.
Water slows down enemies, making them more vulnerable to follow-up attacks and increasing the effectiveness of lightning-based skills.
Earth stuns and confuses enemies, disrupting their movement and making it easier to execute combos.
Air enables knockbacks and pushes, which can control crowds by repositioning enemies, pushing them off ledges, or creating space around the player. 
Sub-elements like Ice (Water), Thunder (Fire), or Wind (Air) appear depending on environmental factors or special enchantments, adding another layer of strategy.

5. Weapon Loadouts and Class Combos:
Players can equip three weapons in their loadout, each with a specific moveset, skill set, and combo potential. Weapons are class-neutral, allowing every class to wield any weapon but with optimized perks. Different weapon types grant access to unofficial subclasses based on loadout selection. For instance, a Mage wielding a staff, a holy relic, and a healing tool functions as a Cleric, while a Rogue using kunai, a ninjato, and shurikens leans toward a Ninja playstyle. The ability to switch between weapons mid-combat allows for on-the-fly strategy changes, ensuring combat never feels repetitive and encouraging players to experiment with new weapon combinations.

6. Knockback and Stagger System:
Knockback is tied to a level-based mechanic where players can launch enemies if they hold a significant level advantage, with stronger foes showing resistance or only staggering.
When matched against similarly leveled enemies, players must rely on quick staggers and positioning rather than sheer force, while stronger enemies may completely resist knockbacks, turning the tide against the player.

7. Enemy Behavior and Targeting:
Enemy AI varies, with some rushing directly at the player, others staying back to strike from a distance, and elite enemies applying special tactics or status effects.
Players can choose between multi-target crowd control attacks or precise single-target moves, with an optional lock-on system inspired by Dark Souls for focused battles.
Switching between third- and first-person perspectives allows for a tailored combat experience, with first-person mode available for ranged attacks like bows, guns, or throwing stars.

8. Camera and Perspective Switching:
Primarily played in third-person, players can zoom in to a first-person view for ranged weapons, allowing for higher precision when targeting specific enemies or weak points.
The camera can be adjusted to the playerâ€™s preference for either an up-close view of the action or a wider angle, giving more control over battlefield awareness and crowd management.

Overall Combat Feel
The combat in Arcane Dominion combines the intensity of fast-paced action with the depth of strategic elements, where split-second decisions make the difference between victory and defeat. Players will feel empowered by a system that rewards skill, strategy, and creativity in combat, with every weapon swing, elemental effect, and ultimate attack contributing to a dynamic, high-stakes experience. The ability to adapt in real time using weapon and elemental combinations, while countering hordes of enemies, makes each battle feel unique and deeply satisfying.
